    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Linda a graduate of Worcester Polytechnic Institute with a degree in Computer Science and a minor in Interactive Media and Game Development. 
        She was first introduced to video games when her father gave her a Sega Genesis controller in Kindergarten. 
        Ever since, Linda has been a passionate gamer, collecting and playing many different video game consoles over the year. 
        This led her to create a youtube channel in 2011 where Linda did video game walkthroughs and reviews. 
        Since then, Linda's youtube channel has grown and she creates videos for her channel professionally. 
        All of this caused Linda to find her way to WPI and to pursue a career in CS and IMGD. 
        She has enjoyed her career path so much that she wants to teach others her craft.
